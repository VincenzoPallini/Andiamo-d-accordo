# Design and development of a social application to support users with autism spectrum disorder 


 

This thesis project concerns the design of a mobile device application aimed at people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goal of the application is to help these people create new friendships by participating in meetings organized by other users registered to the application.

The application is very easy to use. Users can register by entering their personal information, such as name, age, interests, and skills. After registration, users can use the app's map to find other users who are nearby. Users can then exchange messages with other users and arrange meetings in which they want to participate.

The application was built in Android, Java, and Google APIs. The cloud-based NoSQL database provided by Firebase Realtime Database was used to store user data and meeting information.

The application is still under development, but it has already received positive feedback from some users. Users have appreciated the ease of use of the application and the ability to meet other people with ASD who share their interests.

The app has the potential to improve the quality of life for people with ASD, allowing them to create new friendships and feel less lonely.
